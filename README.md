Draw a number (0 - 9) in the box. When you click submit, the image will be passed through a simple convolutional neural network trained on the MNIST dataset which will try to accurately classify the number you have drawn. The model scored an accuracy of ~98% on the validation dataset. To the right of the box you will see what probabilities the model has assigned each number 0 - 9.
